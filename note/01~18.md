## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 12 - Private Folders

- Private Folders

  - A private folder indicates that it is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system

  - The folder and its subfolders are excluded from routing

  - Prefix the folder name with an underscore

- Private Folders contd.

  - For separating UI logic from routing logic

  - For consistently organizing internal files across a project

  - For sorting and grouping files in code editors

  - And finally, for avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions

  - if you want to include an underscore in URL segments you can prefix the folder name with "%5F", which is the URL-encoded form of an underscore

- [Route Groups and Private Folders](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure#route-groups-and-private-folders)

  - 폴더 이름 앞에 `_`를 붙이면 private folder가 되어, 해당 폴더 경로로 이동하더라도 page not found 가 나타난다

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 14 - Layouts

- [Layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts)

  - A page is UI that is unique to a route

  - A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages in the app

## Next.js 14 Routing - 15 - Nested Layouts

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 16 - Route Group Layout

### Route Group Layout

- Route Group uses:

  - To organize your project in a manner that doesn't affect the URL

  - To selectively apply a layout to certain segments while leaving other unchanged

- [Opting specific segments into a layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)

  - 즉, 같은 route group에 있으면 layout 파일에 영향을 받지만, 그렇지 않다면 layout의 영향을 받지 않는다.

## [Next.js 14 Tutorial - 17 - Routing Metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata)

### Configuring Metadata

- Export a static metadata object

- Export a dynamic generateMetadata function

- Metadata rules

  - Both layout.tsx and page.tsx files can export metadata. if defined in a layout, it applies to all pages in that layout, but if defined in a page, it applies only to that page

  - Metadata is read in order, from th root level down to the final page level

  - When there's metadata in multiple places for the same route, the get combined, but page metadata will replace layout metadata if they have same properties

## [Next.js 14 Tutorial - 18 - title Metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#title)

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    template: "...",
    default: "...",
    absolute: "...",
  },
};
```

- Template

  - title.template can be used to add a prefix or a suffix to titles defined in child route segments.

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    template: "%s | Acme",
    default: "Acme", // a default is required when creating a template
  },
};
```

```tsx
//app/about/page
import type { Metadata } from "next";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "About",
};

// Output: <title>About | Acme</title>
// layout에 있는 Acme와 합쳐진 것이 title이 된다
```
