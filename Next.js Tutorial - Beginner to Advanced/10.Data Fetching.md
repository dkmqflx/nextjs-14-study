## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 62 - Data Fetching

### Data Fetching in App Router

- App Router uses the React Server Components (RSC) architecture, which allows us to fetch data using either server components or client components

- It's advantages to fetch data using server components, as they have direct access to server-side resources such as databases or file system

- This not only taps into the server's computational power and proximity to data source for efficient data fetching and rendering but also minimizes the need for client-side processing

<br/>

- We will explore data fetching techniques using both server and client components in Next.js

- Server components support various configurations for caching, revalidating, and optimizing data fetching

- On the client side, data fetching is typically managed through third-party libraries such as TanStack Query which offers its own robust APIs

<br/>

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 63 - Fetching Data with Server Components

### Fetching Data with Server Components

- The RSC architecture in the app router introduces support for async and await keywords in Server Components

- This allows you to use the familiar JavaScript await syntax by defining your component as an asynchronous function

- This is the basis for data fetching in server components

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 64 - Loading and Error States

### Loading and Error States

- Traditionally in React, you might manage these states by creating separate variable and conditionally rendering UI based on their values

- To implement a loading state, define and export a React component in loading.tsx

- For handling errors, define and export a React component in error.tsx

- [github - loading](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/5834017221065309c08898559fafb7bc0c89f21d)

  - setTimeout에 전달된 2초 동안 loading.tsx에 있는 로딩 스피너가 보인다.

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 65 - JSON Server Setup

- JSON server를 server.js 파일로 만들어서 돌리도록 한다

  - `node server` 명령어 실행하면 3002번 포트에 서버가 열리는 것을 확인할 수 있다

- [github - JSON server](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/9e3f3c71124d0dfac677b54d7f8ff9a0d162c436)

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 66 - Caching Data

- By default, Next.js automatically caches the returned values of fetch in the Data Cache on the server

### Caching Data

- [github](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/329dd947ad317c2c01201a626a209df615609617)

  - db.json에서 값을 800에서 700으로 변경시킨 다음 `node server` 명령어를 실행해보면 값이 변경된 것을 확인할 수 있다

  - 하지만 /products 페이지를 가보면 새로고침 하더라도 값이 변경되지 않은채 그대로 인 것을 확인할 수 있다.

  - the data just doesn't update you see next extends the native fetch API and automatically caches the returned values of fetch

  - this caching improves performance and reduces costs

  - specifically the initial data fetched from the Json server price of 800 is stored in what is called a data cache on the server and reused for every subsequent request

  - this eliminates the need to repeatedly query our Json server

- [fetch](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch)

<br/>

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 67 - Data Cache

### Data Cache

- **What is data Cache?**

  - It is a server-side cache that persists the result of data fetches across incoming server requests and deployments

- **Why it is required?**

  - The data cache improves app performance and reduces costs by eliminating the need to re-fetch data from you data source with every request

- **How does it work?**

<img src='./images/10.Data Fetching/01.png'>

- the first time a fetch request is made during rendering, next checks the data cache for a cached response (1. /products -> Rendering -> fetch("../products"))

- if a cache response is found it is returned immediately

- if a cached response is not found (2. Miss), the result is made to the data source which is Json server in our case (3. Data cache -> Data source)

- and the result is stored in the data cache (4. Data source -> SET -> Data cache -> Rendering)

- for subsequent fetch requests with the same URL (5. Rendering -> fetch("../products")) and options,

- the cached value is returned by passing the need to contact the data source (6. Data cache -> HIT -> Rendering)

- [github - Add UsersPage component for fetching and displaying user data](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/01eec1187b10b0d6bf638ff177499ef9ce60c596)

  - /users 페이지에 해당하는 위 코드를 기준으로 실행시, fetch 함수의 url을 아래 그림처럼 `.next` 폴더의 다음과 같은 위치에서 확인할 수 있다.

  - the result of this fetch request is cached in the data cache

  - if we expand the `.next` folder and inspect the cache folder, we see a cache entry corresponding to the user's route from Json placeholder

  - for subsequent fetch requests, next js uses the cash response instead of querying Json placeholders

  - 그렇기 때문에, 값을 변경한 다음 새로운 창을 열어서 같은 경로인 /users에 접근 하더라도 이전에 캐쉬된 값을 그대로 받아서 보여주게 된다

<img src='./images/10.Data Fetching/02.png'>

- [github - Products page](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/329dd947ad317c2c01201a626a209df615609617)

  - /products 페이지에 해당하는 위 코드를 작성하고 실행하게 되면, fetch-cache 폴더안에 새로운 파일이 생성된 것을 확인할 수 있다

  - 그리고 해당 파일을 보면 fetch url에 해당하는 /products가 있는 것을 확인할 수 있다

<img src='./images/10.Data Fetching/03.png'>

- it's also crucial to note that the data cache is a server site persistent cache and not the same as the browser cache

- so if we visit the same route from a different browser,

- for example, Firefox we still see the cashed response from the initial fetch request and not the updated price of 1,000 for product one

  - 즉, 다른 브라우저 사용해서 경로 접속하더라도 같은 업데이트 되지 않은 결과값을 보게 된다

- Json server has the updated price of $1,000 but not our next js application and since this is the default behavior in next js

- I wanted to make sure you understand it thoroughly

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 68 - Opting Out of Caching

### Opting Out of Caching

- [fetch](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch)

- For individual data fetches, you can opt out of caching by setting cache option to `"no-store"`

  - by setting the cache option to `"no-store"`, this ensures data is fetched directly from the data source every time fetch is called in page.

- Once you specify the `"no-store"` option for a fetch request, subsequent fetch requests will also not be cached

- By default Next.js will cache fetch() requests that occur before any dynamic functions (cookies(), headers(), searchParams) are used and will not cache requests found after dynamic functions

- 하나 주의할 점은 아래처럼 `"no-store"` 옵션으로 fetch 하는 요청 아래 fetch가 있으면 둘 다 모두 no-store가 된다

  - 터미널 창을 통해서 이를 확인할 수 있다.

  - 이 부분은 공식 문서에는 없다

```tsx
const productsResponse = await fetch("http://localhost:3001/products", {
  cache: "no-store",
});
const products = await productsResponse.json();

const detailsResponse = await fetch("http://localhost:3001/products/1");
const details = await detailsResponse.json();
```

- [fetchCache](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#fetchcache)

  - 다음과 같은 `"default-cache";` 옵션을 사용하면 products/1은 캐시가 되고 products만 두번 호출하는 것을 알 수 있다.

```tsx
export const fetchCache = "default-cache";

const productsResponse = await fetch("http://localhost:3001/products", {
  cache: "no-store",
});
const products = await productsResponse.json();

const detailsResponse = await fetch("http://localhost:3001/products/1");
const details = await detailsResponse.json();
```

- products는 fetch는 캐시가 되지만 dynamic function 뒤에 오는 products/1 fetch는 캐시가 되지 않는다.

```tsx
const productsResponse = await fetch("http://localhost:3001/products");
const cookieStore = cookies();
const theme = cookieStore.get("theme");

console.log({ theme });

const detailsResponse = await fetch("http://localhost:3001/products/1");
const details = await detailsResponse.json();
const products = await productsResponse.json();
```

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 69 - Request Memoization

### Request Memoization

- Request memoization is a technique that deduplicates requests for the same data within a single render path

- This approach allows for re-use of data in a React Component tree, prevents redundant network calls and enhances performance

- For the initial request, data is fetched from an external source and the result is stored in memory

- Subsequent requests for the same data within the same render path retrieve the result from memory, bypassing the need to make the request again

### Request Memoization contd.

- This optimization not only enhances performance but also simplifies data fetching within a component tree

- When the same data is needed across different components in a route (e.g., in a Layout, Page, and multiple components), it eliminates the need to fetch data at the top of the tree and pass props between components

- Instead, data can be fetched directly within the components that require it, without concerns about the performance implications of multiple netwwork requests for the same data

- 아래 layout.tsx과 같은 products/page.tsx는 같은 api를 fetch 하고 있다

  - [github - Products page](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/329dd947ad317c2c01201a626a209df615609617)

  - [github - Fetch products in layout component](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/c377a2e3df4a27bbbc6f6462a9088795f5d95099)

- 하지만 터미널에서 로그를 확인해보면 한번만 로그가 찍히는 것을 확인할 수 있는데 즉, 한번만 네트워크 요청을 하고 있는 것이다

- request memorization optimizes performance by not making an additional request and reusing the result from a request higher up in the component tree

<img src='./images/10.Data Fetching/04.png'>

- when you navigate to /products in the browser the layout component initiates a fetch request

  - (layout.tsx, fetch("../products"))

  - Rendering -> Request memoization

- it checks in memory to see if a request with the same URL and options has already been made

- finding none, it then checks the data cache which also shows no result

  - Request memoization -> Data cache (MISS)

- it then fetches the data from the Json server

  - Data cache-> Data source (MISS)

- stores the result in the data cache

  - Data source -> Data cache (SET)

- and in memory

  - Data cache -> Request memoization (SET)

- and returns it to the layout component

  - Request memoization -> Rendering

- when the layout renders, it proceeds to render the page component nested inside

- keep in mind we are still in the same render phase and this is not a new page reload

- the page component initiates a fetch request

  - (page.tsx, fetch("../products"))

  - Rendering -> Request memoization

- since the URL and options are the same as the one already in memory the result of that request is returned to the page component

  - Request memoization -> Rendering (HIT)

- there's no need to check the data cache nor make an additional request to the data source improving overall performance

- this is request memorization

- reusing the results of requests within the same render phase

### Request Memoization contd.

- Request memoization is a React feature, not specially a Next.js feature

- Memoization only applies to the GET method in fetch requests

- Memoization only applies within the React Component tree. It does not extend to fetch requests in Route Handlers as they are not part of the React component tree

- For cases where fetch is not suitable (e.g., some database clients, CMS clients, or GraphQL clients), you can use the React cache function to memoize functions

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 70 - Time based Data Revalidation

### Caching in Next.js

- By default, Next.js caches all fetch requests in the data cache, which is a persistent HTTP cache on the server

- This helps optimize pages such as a blog post where content rarely changes

- We also know that we can opt out of caching

  - by using the **cache: "no-store"** option in a fetch request

  - by using a dynamic function before making the fetch request

  - by using a route segment config like **fetch-cache** or **dynamic**

- A news website a great example where you want to make sure you're fetching the latest data at all times

### Caching in Next.js contd.

- This approach seems binary: either caching or no caching

- In real-world applications, there are scenarios where a middle ground is required

- For example, an event listings page might have event details such as schedule or venue information that change occasionally

- In this case, it is acceptable to fetch updated data once every hour as freshness is not critical

- For such scenarios, Next.js allow us to revalidate the cache

### Revalidation

- Revalidation is the process of purging the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data

- Time-based revalidation

  - Next.js automatically revalidates data after a certain amount of time has passed

- [github](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/70a6c0531be25a09da56ee13a878c5446e28a5cd)

  - 설정한 10초 이전에 새로고침을 하면 데이터를 가져오는 GET 로그가 찍히지 않지만, 10초 이후에 새로고침을 하면 데이터를 가져오는 GET 로그가 찍히는 것을 확인할 수 있다.

- You can set the revalidate route segment configuration to establish the default revalidation time for a layout or page: `export const revalidate = 10;`

- Regrading the revalidation frequency, the lowest revalidate time across each layout and page of single route will determine the revalidation frequency of the entire route

  - 즉, page.tsx의 revalidate가 10이고 layout.tsx의 revalidate가 20이면 revalidate가 10으로 적용된다.
