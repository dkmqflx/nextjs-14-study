## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 28 - Parallel Routes

- [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes)

- Parallel routes are an advanced routing mechanism that allows for the simultaneous rendering of multiple pages within the same layout

### Parallel Routes contd.

- Parallel routes in Next.js are defined using a feature known as slots

- Slots help structure our content in a modular fashion

- To define a slot, we use the '@folder' naming convention

- Each slot is then passed as a prop to its corresponding 'layout.tsx' file

### Parallel Routes Benefits

- A clear benefit of parallel routes is their ability to split a single layout into various slots, making the code more manageable

  - Independent route handling

  - Sub-navigation

### [Independent route handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#loading-and-error-ui)

- Each slot of your layout, such as user analytics or revenue metrics, can have its own loading and error states

- This granular control is particularly beneficial in scenarios where different sections of the page load at varying speeds or encounter unique errors

### [Sub-navigation in routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#active-state-and-navigation)

- Each slot of your dashboard can essentially function as a mini-application, complete with its own navigation and state management

- This is especially useful in a complex application such as our dashboard where different sections serve distinct purpose

- 여기서 말하는 것은 공식문서의 Soft Navigation 같음

  - Soft Navigation: During client-side navigation, Next.js will perform a partial render, changing the subpage within the slot, while maintaining the other slot's active subpages, even if they don't match the current URL.

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 29 - Unmatched Routes

### Navigation from the UI

- In the case of navigation within the UI, Next.js retains the previously active state of a slot regardless of changes in the URL

### Page reload

- Next.js immediately searches for a default.tsx within each unmatched slot

- The presence of this file is critical, as it provides the default content that Next.js will render in the user interface

- If this default.tsx file is missing in any of the unmatched slots for the current route, Next.js will render a 404 error

### default.tsx

- The 'default.tsx' file in Next.js serves as a fallback to render content when the framework cannot retrieve a slot's active state from the current URL

- You have complete freedom to define the UI for unmatched routes: you can either mirror the content found in page.tsx or craft an entirely custom view

<br/>

- [Active state and navigation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#active-state-and-navigation)

- By default, Next.js keeps track of the active state (or subpage) for each slot. However, the content rendered within a slot will depend on the type of navigation:

- Soft Navigation: During client-side navigation, Next.js will perform a partial render, changing the subpage within the slot, while maintaining the other slot's active subpages, even if they don't match the current URL.

  - 다른 slot은 변경되지 않는다

- Hard Navigation: After a full-page load (browser refresh), Next.js cannot determine the active state for the slots that don't match the current URL. Instead, it will render a default.js file for the unmatched slots, or 404 if default.js doesn't exist.

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 31 - Intercepting Routes

- Advanced Routing Pattern

  - Parallel routes

  - Intercepting routes

### [Intercepting Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes)

- Intercepting routes allow you to intercept or stop the default routing behavior to present an alternate view or component when navigating through the UI, while still preserving the intended route for scenarios like page reloads

- This can be useful if you want to show a route while keeping the context of the current page

### Intercepting Route Conventions

- (.) to match segments on the same level

- (..) to match segments one level above

- (..)(..) to match segments two levels above

- (...) to match segments from the root app directory

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 32 - Parallel Intercepting Routes

### [Modals](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/a4e33ee7276152da966918a7786e286e21583c73)

- Parallel Routes can be used together with Intercepting Routes to create modals that support deep linking. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:

  - Making the modal content shareable through a URL.

  - Preserving context when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.

  - Closing the modal on backwards navigation rather than going to the previous route.

  - Reopening the modal on forwards navigation.

- [github](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/a4e33ee7276152da966918a7786e286e21583c73)

  - 코드상 이미지를 클릭하면 url이 변경되더라도 해당 url의 page 파일의 UI가 보이지 않고 intercepting route로 인해 intercepting route page에 있는 모달이 열린다.

  - 뒤로가기를 클릭하면 모달이 닫히고, 앞으로가기를 클릭하면 다시 모달이 열린다

  - 새로고침을 하면 url에 해당하는 page 파일의 UI가 보이게 된다

  - 여기서 modal을 만들 때 @modal고 같이 slot을 만들어서 아래처럼 parallel route 처리를 해주어야 한다

    - 처음에는 UI상에 보이지 않더라도 intercepting을 통해 해당 UI가 보여야 하기 때문이 아닐까?

  ```tsx
  export default function Layout(props: {
    modal: React.ReactNode;
    children: React.ReactNode;
  }) {
    return (
      <>
        {props.modal}
        {props.children}
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
