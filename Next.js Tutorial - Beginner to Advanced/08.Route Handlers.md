## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 33 - Route Handlers

### [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers#convention)

- We've learned how to route to pages

- We can also create custom request handlers for our routes using a feature called route handlers

- Unlike page routes, which respond with HTML content, route handlers allow you to create RESTful endpoints, giving you full control over the response

- There is no overhead of having to create and configure a separate server

- Route handlers are also great for making external API requests

- Route handlers run server-side, ensuring that sensitive information like private keys remains secure and never gets shipped to the browser

- Route handlers are the equivalent of API routes in Page router

- [Route Resolution](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers#route-resolution)

  - page.tsx파일과 동일하게 있으면 route.ts가 더 우선되기 때문에 api 폴더를 만들어서 그 안에 route 파일을 생성해준다

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 41 - Headers in Route Handlers

- HTTP headers represent the metadata associated with an API request and response

- Request Headers

  - These are sent by the client, such as a web browsers, to the server. They contain essential information about the request, which helps the server understand and process it correctly

  - 'User-Agent' which identifies the browser and operating system to the server

  - 'Accept' which indicates the content types like text, video, or image formats that the client can process

  - 'Authorization' header used by the client to authenticate itself th toe server

- Response Headers

  - These are sent back from the server to the client. They provide information about the server and the data being sent in the response.

  - 'Content-Type' header which indicates the media type of the response. It tells the client what the data type of the returned content is, such as text/html for HTML documents, application/json for JSON data, etc.

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 42 - Cookies in Route Handlers

- Cookies are small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser

- They browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests

- Cookies are mainly used for three purposes

  - Session management like logins and shopping carts

  - Personalization like user preference and themes

  - Tracking like recording and analyzing user behavior

- [Cookies](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers#cookies)

## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 43 - Caching in Route Handlers

- Route Handlers are not cached by default

- [Caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers#caching)

- [github](https://github.com/gopinav/Next.js-14-Tutorials/commit/70e167566f916d3deaadc310fad0a5d274befd2f)

  - 기본적으로 caching이 되지 않기 때문에 다른 date가 api 호출 때 마다 보이게 된다

  - 즉, /time 페이지에서 새로고침하면 새로운 date가 화면에 보이게 된다
