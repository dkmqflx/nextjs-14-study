## Next.js 14 Tutorial - 12 - Private Folders

- Private Folders

  - A private folder indicates that it is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system

  - The folder and its subfolders are excluded from routing

  - Prefix the folder name with an underscore

- Private Folders contd.

  - For separating UI logic from routing logic

  - For consistently organizing internal files across a project

  - For sorting and grouping files in code editors

  - And finally, for avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions

  - if you want to include an underscore in URL segments you can prefix the folder name with "%5F", which is the URL-encoded form of an underscore

- [Private Folders](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation#private-folders)

  - 폴더 이름 앞에 `_`를 붙이면 private folder가 되어, 해당 폴더 경로로 이동하더라도 page not found 가 나타난다
